# simplified-tensor-library
This repository is mainly a practice implemented by a C++ beginer. Some basic concepts about tensor and template expression are implemented here. I try to make the codes simple and easy to understand, instead of making it efficient or generalized.

### build and run

The codes are totally simple, so I often write some simple codes for testing in `./eleven/main.cpp`. Just complie this file using `g++` or whatever. The script `./eleven/scripts/build.sh` will do the same thing. 

### about codes

All interfaces will be declared in `./eleven/tensor/tensor.h`. More details about implement can be found in `./eleven/guide.md`.

### TODO

This repository will be further developed, but I don't have any plan.
